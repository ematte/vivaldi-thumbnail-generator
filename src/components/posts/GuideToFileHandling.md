Handling files in javascript applications can sometimes be a bit confusing. There are multiple ways to read files, and many gotchas along the way. Lately I've been working on [a side-project](https://vivaldi-thumbnails.netlify.com/), which was based around reading and manipulating files to generate custom thumbnails for Vivaldi browser's speed dials. I was able to do it all inside the browser, without any server-side processing, and I want to share with you everything that I've learned.

I will try to explain everything in as much detail as possible, so if you're looking for a quick copy-and-paste solution, this isn't it. It is a complete explanation of everything that goes into working with files in the browser. It is designed to give you a deeper understanding of the topic and act as a future reference.

It covers:

- selecting files from the user's filesystem
- properties of files and how to access information about them
- different ways files can be represented in javascript (`Blob`, `File`, dataURL and objectURL)
- reading text and image files using `FileReader` and `URL.createObjectURL`
- handling errors and loading states
- common gotchas and how to avoid them + some bonus tips

It also acts as an introduction to my guide on using the `Canvas` API, which is coming very soon, so stay tuned for that! That said, I'm not going to get into styling the file input or drag-and-drop interactions in this article, but if you want to learn about that, let me know in the comments.

## Selecting files

To allow your users to select a file from their device, you will first have to create an input with the type of _file_.

```html
<input type="file" id="inputElement" />
```

To actually get the files from this input, you will need to access the `files` property of the input element. It's best to do that by registering a _change_ event listener on the input element. This way a callback function will be called every time a user selects a file.

The way you do that will depend on the framework you're using. To make this guide as widely applicable as possible, we will be using vanilla JS.

```javascript
// get a reference to the inputElement in any way you choose
const inputElement = document.getElementById("inputElement")

// get the value once
inputElement.files[0]

// get the value every time the user selects a new file
inputElement.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
	// e.target points to the input element
	const selectedFile = e.target.files[0]
})
```

The resulting **selectedFile** is a `File` object.

---

## Properties of files

The file input gives us `File` objects, so in addition to the contents of the file itself, we have access to some additional information, such as:

- `name` - the file's name, including the extension but without the path (e.g. "cat_photo.png")
- `size` - the file's size in bytes. To get the size in a more human readable format, you can use a library like [filesize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filesize) or [bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes). For simple use cases, you can even write your own conversion logic.
- `type` - the file's [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) (e.g. "text/plain", "image/png")
- `lastModified` - the last modified date of the file, represented as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970 at midnight). You can use the [Date constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) to convert this timestamp to a more useful javascript `Date` object.

`File`s also have two other properties: `File.lastModifiedDate` and `File.webkitRelativePath`, the first of which is deprecated and the other non-standard, so you should probably avoid using them. Keep in mind that all of these properties are read-only.

### Files & Blobs

In addition to `File`, javascript has another way of representing files, called `Blob`

`Blob` contains a generic file's data, along with information about its size and type. `File` is actually just a more specialised `Blob`, used to represent specifically files in a user's filesystem. It inherits all of Blob's methods and properties and contains some additional information about the file's name and last modified date.

These two are basically interchangeable, and you can use one almost everywhere you can use the other. If you absolutely need to convert them though, you can do so using the other type's constructor.

```javascript
const file = new File([blob], "fileName", { type: blob.type })
const blob = new Blob([file], { type: file.type })
```

---

## Reading the contents of files

Okay, so we know how to select and get information about files, but how do we actually read what's inside them? Well, that depends on what kind of file it is and what you want to do with it. For the purposes of this article, we will only focus on images and text files.

The most flexible and well-supported method of reading a file's contents is the [FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader). It's an event driven API, so instead of simply calling a function and getting the file's contents, we must take some extra steps.

Let's start with reading a text file:

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById("inputElement")

inputElement.onchange = (e) => {
	const file = inputElement.files[0]
	if (!file) return
	const reader = new FileReader()
	reader.onload = (e) => {
		// e.target points to the reader
		const textContent = e.target.result
		console.log(`The content of ${file.name} is ${textContent}`)
	}
	reader.onerror = (e) => {
		const error = e.target.error
		console.error(`Error occured while reading ${file.name}`, error)
	}
	reader.readAsText(file)
}
```

1. First we get the file input element, and register a _change_ event listener on it
2. We get the selected file
3. We check if a file was actually selected and if not, (which might happen for example if a user clicks 'cancel' in the selection window) we exit the function
4. Next, we create an instance of FileReader
5. Then we register any event handlers we might need. To access the file contents we only really need the _load_ event, which triggers when the read operation has finished **succesfully**. However it's usually a good idea to register an error handler as well. A full list of possible events is available a bit further into the article, along with some error handling tips, so keep reading ðŸ˜‰
6. **After** all event listeners are registered, we initiate the read operation by calling one of the _readAs_ methods, in this case `readAsText`
7. After the reading operation is finished, the file contents will be available the `reader.result` property, which we can access inside the _load_ event handler (the `reader.onload` callback function).

**Quick tip:** You can access the reader inside an event handler in multiple ways: `reader === e.target === this`. Keep in mind that `this` is not available in arrow functions.

```javascript
reader.onchange = () => console.log(reader.result) // closure
reader.onchange = (e) => console.log(e.target.result) // event target
reader.onchange = function() => console.log(this.result) // 'this'
```

### Error Handling

In case of an error, the _error_ event handler is called, and you can find the Error object in `reader.error`. Possible error codes are:

- `FileError.NOT_FOUND_ERR`Â - the file was not found
- `FileError.NOT_READABLE_ERR`Â - the file could not be read
- `FileError.SECURITY_ERR`Â - there was a security issue
- `FileError.ABORT_ERR`Â - thrown whenÂ `reader.abort()`Â is called while there's no read operation in progress

Most of the time there is no need to differentiate between these error types, maybe except for `ABORT_ERR` which is generally harmless and can be ignored.

### Ready State

The read operation is asynchronous, so don't try accessing `reader.result` right after the _readAs_ call. If you really need to check the `reader.result` value outside of the _load_ event handler, make sure to first check the value of `reader.readyState`, which will be one of 3 values:

- `0` - The reader has been created, but no _readAs_ method was called yet. (EMPTY)
- `1` - One of the _readAs_ methods has been called. A read operation is in progress, and no errors have occurred yet. (LOADING)
- `2` - The operation has finished. This could mean one of three things: the `File` has been read succesfully, a read error has occured, or `reader.abort()` was called and the operation was canceled. (DONE)

The `reader.result` property will be populated only in case of a successful read operation. In all other cases it will be `null`.

```javascript
const reader = new FileReader()
// readyState is 0, result is null
reader.onload = () => {
	// readyState is 2, result is the file's content
}
reader.onerror = () => {
	// readyState is 2, result is null
}
// readyState is 0, result is null
reader.readAsText(file)
// readyState is 1, result is null
```

The same applies to `reader.error` which should be accessed inside the _error_ event handler.

### FileReader Event Types

We've already explored the two most common read event types, now let's quickly cover the rest. FileReader has six event types:

- `load` - triggered when a read operation is **successfully** completed
- `error` - triggered when a read operation encounters an error
- `progress` - triggered periodically while a `File` or `Blob` is being read and contains information about the progress of the operation. Can be used to implement loading bars.
- `abort` - triggered when a read operation is cancelled, i.e. when `reader.abort()` is called
- `loadstart` - triggered when a read operation starts
- `loadend` - triggered when a read operation is finished, regardless of if it succeeded or failed

You've probably noticed that FileReader events work similarly to regular DOM events. I find that thinking about them as such makes it a lot easier to understand their non-linear, asynchronous nature.

**Sidenote:** Just as with DOM events, it's possible to register event handlers by using `addEventListener`, or by assigning a callback function to the 'on*eventname'* property of a reader.

### Blob.text()

It's also worth noting that for reading text files there exists a newer and simpler method: `Blob.text()`. Remember that `File` is just a `Blob` with some added functionality, so it inherits all of Blob's methods, including this one. This means you can use this method on both Blobs and Files

```javascript
// using promise.then()
file.text().then(text => /* do something */);
// using async/await
const text = await file.text();
```

Doesn't it look nicer? I think it does, but there's a catch. This API is quite new and the [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_blob_text) is still pretty poor.

## Working with images

Now that we know how to read text files, let's move on to something more exciting: images. To illustrate this topic, we're going to build a simple preview of the selected image.

### File types

First let's make sure that the selected file is actually an image. We can do that with the help of the `accept` attribute.

```html
<!-- any image type will be accepted -->
<input type="file" accept="image/*" />
<!-- only .png, .jpg, and .gif files will be accepted -->
<input type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif" />
```

The `accept` attribute, allows you to specify what kind of files the user will be allowed to select. It uses a comma-separated list of unique file type specifiers. Each type specifier can be in one of the following formats:

- A case-insensitive filename extension, starting with a period (".") character. For example:Â `.jpg`,Â `.JPEG`, `.gif`, `.doc`
- A [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types), for example: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `text/plain`, `audio/wav`
- `image/*`Â which means "any image file"
- `audio/*`Â which means "any audio file"
- `video/*`Â which means "any video file"

You can mix and match these to suite your particular use-case.

HTML validation isn't perfect though. For example, on Windows it will only hide the files not matching your criteria, but you can still select "All files (\*.\*)" or use drag-and-drop to select any file you want. All off this means that it's also a good idea to check the file type inside your javascript code.

```javascript
// allows any image file
if (file.type.startsWith("image/")) {
	/* handle the files */
}

// only allows specified types
if (["image/png", "image/jpeg"].includes(file.type)) {
	/* handle the files */
}
```

Or you could set up separate processing flows for different file types

```javascript
if (file.type.startsWith("image/")) {
	reader.onload = processImage
	reader.readAsDataURL(file)
} else if (file.type.startsWith("text/")) {
	reader.onload = processText
	reader.readAsText(file)
}
```

Unfortunately `startsWith()` and `includes()` don't work in older browsers like Internet Explorer, so if you need to support them, you might want to look into some workarounds or polyfills.

Also, keep in mind that "any image file" will match (among others):

- images with less-than-perfect browser support, like `webp`
- images with transparency, like `png`
- animated images, like `gif`'s

So make sure you support all of these functionalities, or explicitly specify only the types you plan on supporting.

### Reading image files

To display a selected image, we will need an HTML img and a URL for the `img.src` attribute. There are two different ways to represent a local image file as a URL, a dataURL and objectURL. There are some important differences between the two, so let's quickly run through them.

**DataURL â€”** It's the result of `reader.readAsDataURL()`. It contains the actual binary data of a file encoded using base64 and represented as a string. It's different from a basic base64 encoding because it alos contains some additional information - namely the file's type.

It's format can vary a bit depending on the type of data it represents, but for images it looks like this: `data:<mediatype>;base64,<data>`, where `<mediatype>` is a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) and `<data>` is the base64-encoded file.

Because it actually contains the file's data, it can be used anywhere after it's generated, without the need for the original file. Pretty cool!

**ObjectURL â€”** It's the result of `URL.createObjectURL()`. It is a newer API, but still pretty well supported. It won't however work in IE version 9 and lower.

It's faster and in my opinion, simpler to work with than `FileReader` but it comes with its own set of headaches and limitations. In contrast to dataURL, it doesn't actually contain any file data. It's just a reference to a local file, and means nothing outside of the context in which it was created.

The url also has to be revoked when it is no longer needed. The browser will automatically release objectURLs when the document is unloaded, however for optimal performance and memory usage, you shouldn't rely on that behavior, especially in large applications with many objectURLs. Instead you should explicitly call `URL.revokeObjectURL()` when the url is no longer needed, for example in the `image.onload` event handler, which we will discuss later.

### Displaying selected images

Most of the time objectURLs and dataURLs can be used interchangaebly, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. This means you should probably learn both and choose which one to use on a case-by-case basis. Let's look at examples of both of them, to get a better feeling for how each one works.

```html
<!-- HTML markup for the next two examples -->
<input type="file" id="inputElement" accept="image/*" />
<div id="previewContainer">
	<!-- The preview will go here -->
</div>
```

### Using dataURL & FileReader

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById("inputElement")
const previewContainer = document.getElementById("previewContainer")

inputElement.onchange = (e) => {
	const file = e.target.files[0]
	if (!file) return
	const reader = new FileReader()
	reader.onload = (e) => {
		const img = document.createElement("img")
		const dataURL = e.target.result
		img.src = dataURL
		previewContainer.appendChild(img)
	}
	reader.readAsDataURL(file)
}
```

1. We register a _change_ event listener on the file input
2. Inside the `onchange` callback, we get the selected file and create an instance of `FileReader`
3. We register a _load_ event listener on the reader
4. Inside the `onload` callback we create a new image element,
5. Then we get the dataURL from `reader.result` (remember, `e.target` points to the `reader`) and assign it to the `img.src` attribute like we would in HTML
6. Once the _src_ attribute is set, we append the entire _img_ element to the DOM as a child of our _previewContainer_. (We actually could have just created the _img_ tag in HTML and updated the _src_ attribute in javascript, but doing it this way actually prepares us for working with multiple images at once, and manipulating images in a `Canvas`)
7. When everything is set, we start the read operation using `reader.readAsDataURL(file)`, which will trigger our `onload` listener when it finishes reading the file.

### Using objectURL

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById("inputElement")
const previewContainer = document.getElementById("previewContainer")

inputElement.onchange = (e) => {
	const file = e.target.files[0]
	if (!file) return
	const img = document.createElement("img")
	img.onload = (e) => {
		URL.revokeObjectURL(e.target.src) // optional, but recommended
	}
	const objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(file)
	img.src = objectURL
	previewContainer.appendChild(img)
}
```

1. We register a _change_ event listener on the file input
2. Inside the `onchange` callback, we get the selected file and create a new image element
3. We register a _load_ event handler on the image
4. Inside the `onload` callback, `URL.revokeObjectURL()` will revoke the objectURL once the image is fully loaded and the url is no longer needed. This step is not necessary, but highly recommended. Keep in mind that if you are going to need that url somewhere else later, you shouldn't revoke it yet.
5. Once the image is fully loaded, we won't need the objectURL anymore. So inside the `onload` callback, we revoke that url. To revoke the url we need to pass it to the `URL.revokeObjectURL()` method. We get the url straight from the image's src attribute. which isn't necessary in this example, but it allows us to get the url, regardless of where the callback function is defined.
6. We create an objectURL, by passing the selected file as an argument to `URL.createObjectURL()` and assign it to the `img.src` attribute.
7. Once the _src_ attribute is set, we append the entire _img_ element to the DOM as a child of our _previewContainer_.

**Sidenote:** Elsewhere you might see images created by using the Image constructor i.e. `const img = new Image()`. Most of the time it's equivalent to `document.createElement("img")` and I've never had any problems with either of them. However there might be some edge cases (described in this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6241716/is-there-a-difference-between-new-image-and-document-createelementimg)), which seem to make the latter a more reliable option.

---

## Reading multiple files

Let's start this section by clearing something up. The `files` property isn't actually an `Array`, even though it looks like one ðŸ˜®. It's a special `FileList` data type. That means it doesn't have access to the normal `Array` methods (like `map`, `forEach`, `reduce`), so to iterate over the list you will have to get creative. I will show you a few different ways to do this, but if you want to know more, check out this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40902437/cant-use-foreach-with-filelist).

```javascript
    // use a 'for' loop
    for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
      /* handle the files */
    }

    // use a 'for...of' loop
    for (let file of files) {
    	/* handle the files */
    }

    // below, I used 'forEach' as an example but it'll work with any array method

    // call the function with a bound 'this'
    Array.prototype.forEach.call(files, file => {/* handle the files */})
    [].forEach.call(files, file => {/* handle the files */})

    // use ES6 spread syntax to transform it into an Array
    [...files].forEach(files, file => {/* handle the files */})

    // use Array.from() to transform it into an Array (equivalent to spread syntax)
    Array.from(files).forEach(files, file => {/* handle the files */})
```

Now that that's out of the way, let's continue. By default the file input only allows us to select a single file. To allow selecting multiple files at once, add the `multiple` attribute to the html element.

```html
<input type="file" multiple />
```

You might also have noticed that even though we've only been working with a singe file (until now), we always had to write `files[0]`. What is that all about? Well, regardless of whether the `multiple` attribute is set or not, `inputElement.files` is always a `FileList`. This means that even if the input only accepts a single file, you still have to provide the index, which in the case of an only item is 0.

```javascript
// get number of selected files
let numFiles = inputElement.files.length

let file
// get a single file
file = inputElement.files[0]
// or using the special 'FileList.item()' method
file = inputElement.files.item(0)
```

Let's put all of this together and create a list of previews for multiple files, using `FileReader`. If you want to, you can obviously do this with objectURLs instead. Because we've already done most of this before, I'll only use comments to call out important bits of the code. If you skipped the previous sections, I recommend you go back and catch up, I'll wait ðŸ˜‰

```html
<!-- Modified HTML from the previous example. Notice the 'multiple' attribute -->
<input type="file" id="inputElement" accept="image/*" multiple />
<ul id="previewList">
	<!-- The previews will go here, inside individual list items -->
</ul>
```

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById("inputElement")
const previewList = document.getElementById("previewList")

inputElement.onchange = (e) => {
	const files = Array.from(e.target.files) // transform FileList into an Array

	files.forEach((file) => {
		if (!file) return // if you use a regular 'for' loop, use continue instead

		// if the file isn't an image, we skip it
		if (!file.type.startsWith("image/")) return

		// create a separate reader for every file to avoid conflicts
		const reader = new FileReader()

		reader.onload = (e) => {
			const listItem = document.createElement("li")
			const img = document.createElement("img")

			const dataURL = e.target.result
			img.src = dataURL
			img.height = 100 // set a uniform height for all images (optional)

			listItem.appendChild(img)
			previewList.appendChild(listItem)
		}

		reader.readAsDataURL(file)
	})
}
```

As you can see, we create a separate `FileReader` instance for every file. The same could probably be achieved by calling `readAsDataURL` inside a `loadend` event handler, but this does the job and is probably faster anyway.

## Wrapping up

I know that the end of the post is a strange place to introduce myself, but... Hi! My name is Mateusz and this is my first real tutorial / guide. I hope it was clear and got you the answers you were looking for. All constructive criticism is welcome, as I plan on writing a lot more of these.

Like I said at the beginning I'm currently working on part 2 of this guide, which will cover the Canvas API, so consider following me here, or on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/HadrysMateusz), to know when it comes out.

Also, if you're a [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) fan like I am, check out my [Vivaldi Thumbnail Generator](https://vivaldi-thumbnails.netlify.com/), it's a free tool I created, because I was tired of creating thumbnails manually. It uses a lot of the concepts from this post and you can check out the enitre source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ematte/vivaldi-thumbnail-generator).

If something was unclear, or you would like me to expand on some topic, let me know in the comments. Okay, I'll stop rambling now. Have a great rest of your day!
