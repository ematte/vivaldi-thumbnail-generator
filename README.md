## About the project

I created this tool because I was tired of manually putting together thumbnails for my Speed Dials.
I've been an avid user of [Vivaldi browser](https://vivaldi.com/) for a long time. I love the complete customisability it provides. It provides a great new tab experience called Speed Dials, but the thumbnails it generates are based on a screenshot of the page which doesn't provide a lot of information. That's why I created VTG, it creates thumbnails that are readable at a glance, and fully customisable so they will always match your theme.

## Technologies used

It's created using React (CRA) and Styled-Components.
All image processing is done on the client-side, using the Canvas API.
